## Memory Architecture
- Memory speed is inversely related to the size
    - Smaller memory is faster
        - Fastest memory is CPU registers
        - CPU cache (on x86, L1, L2, L3)
          - L1 cache ~64k..256k single core
          - L2 cache ~256k..1M shared by multiple cores (2, 4, 6, 8 cores?)
          - L3 cache ~4M..32M shared by multiple (typically all) cores
        - Nonvolatile memory
          - SSD (solid state drive, slower than RAM)
          - Hard drive (slowest)

- On a single computer, there is only one memory. Generally 2 banks on a PC.
- Memory bandwidth is the amount of data that can be transferred per second.
  - Number is highly dependent on the pattern of usage
  - Read the same memory location repeatedly (cache, fastest)
  - Sequential access (RAM, full rated speed)
    - Usually enough for more than 1 core, usually not more than 2 going full tilt.
    - This means that beyond two cores, memory is the limiting factor unless you can do significant computation between memory accesses.
    - DDR4, DDR5 RAM supports burst mode (first access is slow, subsequent 7 are 1 clock each)
    - With 2 banks, 16 sequential accesses
    - RAM timings [Tom's Hardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/cas-latency-ram-cl-timings-glossary-definition,6011.html)
      - CL-Timing (CAS Latency, RAS to CAS Delay, RAS Precharge Delay)
      - tRCD: RAS to CAS Delay (same bank)
      - tRAS: RAS Precharge Delay (between banks)
      - tRRD: RAS to RAS Delay (between banks)
      - Micron 32GB DDR5-5600 ECC UDIMM 2Rx8 timings: 46-45-45
        - Access time within a row: 46 clocks * 1/5600 GHz = 8.2 ns
        - Access time between rows: 45 clocks * 1/5600 GHz = 8 ns additional
        - Access time between banks: 45 clocks * 1/5600 GHz = 8 ns additional

    - About 2% of DRAM bandwidth is used for refresh
